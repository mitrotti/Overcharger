# Overcharger

### Introduction

Simple Android App that "announces" (TTS) when the battery changes 10%. The idea is to be notified when your phone has reached the level you desire, in order to prevent overcharging, and improve battery life.

This is not meant to be a "full-blown" Android project, but rather, a showcase of the following Android skills:
- Broadcast Receiver
- Preference saving/storage
- Multi-threading
- Basic UI design

### Future work

Some potential improvement ideas:
- Polish the UI
- There could be an option to let the user choose if they only want one anouncment
- It might be possible/useful to fire the app when the charger is plugged in
